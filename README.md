# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Recognition-using-Image-Processing-in-MATLAB

## Overview

This MATLAB project demonstrates a simplified Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (VNPR) system using image processing techniques. The goal is to detect and recognize license plates in images containing vehicles.

## Key Features

- License plate localization using edge detection and morphological operations.
- Connected component analysis for identifying potential license plate regions.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for recognizing characters on the license plate.
- Basic preprocessing techniques for image enhancement.
